# MagCal
Magnetic sensor calibration in c# using Q. Li ellipsoid fitting. The original algorithm has been published by Q. LI here: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23377-ellipsoid-fitting

This implementation is a straight conversion of the algorithm written in C and published here: https://sites.google.com/site/sailboatinstruments1/step-1
